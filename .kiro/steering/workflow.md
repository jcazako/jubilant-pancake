# Workflow Instructions

## Task Completion

After completing each task, follow these steps in order:

1. Mark the task checkbox as complete in the tasks.md file (change `[ ]` to `[x]`)
2. Run `git add -A` to stage all changes (including the updated tasks.md)
3. Run `git commit -m "<task title>"` using the title of the completed task as the commit message
